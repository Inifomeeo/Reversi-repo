        <li>The game starts with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the board, two white, two black, so that the same-colored disks are on a diagonal.</li>

        <li>Black moves first.</li>

        <li>Turns consist of placing a piece of your color on the board and so that there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another piece of your color, with one or more opposite colored pieces between them.</li>

        <li>The turn then switches to the second player and they do the same.</li>

        <li>If a player cannot make a valid move they forfeit their turn to the opponent.</li>

        <li>The game ends when neither player can make a valid move or all the spaces on the board have been filled.</li>
